## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the application of lexical analysis and syntactic analysis in the parsing process. By building a lexer and a parser using tools like Bison and a custom AST structure in C, we aim to effectively parse and execute a series of predefined queries.

## Installation

Before setting up the project, you need to install the following tools:

- [Flex (The Fast Lexical Analyzer)](https://github.com/westes/flex)
- [Bison (GNU Parser Generator)](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)

Please follow the installation instructions on their respective homepages to install Flex and Bison on your system.

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository and navigate to the `lab2` directory, use the following script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeTrongDat/itmo/
cd itmo/low-level-programming/lab2
```

## Running the Project

Once you are in the `lab2` directory, compile the project using the provided `Makefile` by running:

```bash
make all
```

This command will compile the lexer and parser, and generate the required executables.
